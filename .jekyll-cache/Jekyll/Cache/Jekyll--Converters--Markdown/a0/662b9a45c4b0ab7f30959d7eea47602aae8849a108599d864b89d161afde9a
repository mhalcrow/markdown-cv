<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>I seek a leadership opportunity applying deep security expertise to
unique challenges.</p>

<p>I am currently the Engineering Manager of the Container Threat
Detection product team at Google. I hired and led a team of software
developers to create a new enterprise security product in Google’s
Cloud Security organization. My team <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-container-threat-detection-overview">shipped
Beta</a> in May 2020.</p>

<p>I have over 20 years of experience in the security industry, during
which time I created <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9400">eCryptfs</a> and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/639427/">fs-crypt</a> in the upstream
Linux kernel. My technology was central in Google’s effort to encrypt
billions of Android phones across the globe, closing a major
competitive gap with the Apple iPhone.</p>

<p>I thrive in ambiguity and relish opportunities to lead the industry in
whatever challenge I take on.</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-container-threat-detection-overview">Container Threat Detection</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>I built the team from scratch, hiring on 9 new employees from
outside the company and transferring in 3 employees from other
teams at Google.</li>
  <li>I designed the kernel instrumentation and the Google service
framework, and I led my team’s execution on an ambitious vision.</li>
  <li>I led Machine Learning experts on my team to produce novel
techniques in the threat detection domain.</li>
</ul>

<p>fs-verity</p>

<ul>
  <li>I wrote the initial prototype of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw5h6aBhu6M">fs-verity</a>
and led my team to drive the implementation through to merging into
the upstream Linux kernel. The fs-verity feature now protects the
integrity of sensitive apps on Android.</li>
</ul>

<p>fs-crypt</p>

<ul>
  <li>I proposed the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/639427/">fs-crypt</a> project, wrote
the design, and wrote the majority of the implemention together
with Ted T’so. I engaged the Android team at Google to ensure that
fs-crypt met platform requirements, extended fs-crypt to support
Inline Cryptographic Engine (ICE) technology that’s part of the ARM
ecosystem, and worked with engineers in the Android organization to
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/11/pixel-security-better-faster-stronger.html">ship
Android N with storage encryption</a> enabled by default.</li>
  <li>fs-crypt also protects user data on Chrome OS and sensitive data on
Google’s production infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloud KMS</p>

<ul>
  <li>I conceived the Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) project
and proposed the initial design. I transitioned the project to
another team that specializes in key management, and they drove it
to commercial success.</li>
</ul>

<p>Customer-supplied Encryption Keys</p>

<ul>
  <li>I led the design and implementation of Customer-supplied Encryption
Keys (CSEK) on Google Compute Engine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compute Engine Persistent Disk Encryption</p>

<ul>
  <li>I proposed, designed, and implemented storage encryption as an
always-on feature of Google Compute Engine’s Persistent Disk, which
was an industry-first accomplishment in the Cloud space. I applied
AEAD encryption to block storage while meeting consistency and
performance requirements, which is a notable technical
achievement.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="microsoft-2009-2011">Microsoft, 2009-2011</h3>

<p>Windows Division, BitLocker</p>

<ul>
  <li>I delivered passphrase-based system volume protectors for the
BitLocker Full Disk Encryption feature, unblocking a significant
number of enterprise customers so they can use Windows-native disk
encryption technology.</li>
  <li>I performed static code analysis of the Windows code base.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ibm-2003-2009">IBM, 2003-2009</h3>

<p>Linux Technology Center, Security</p>

<ul>
  <li>I created eCryptfs.</li>
  <li>I wrote extensive detailed documentation of low-level Linux system
call interfaces, which was critical to achieve the world’s first
Common Criteria certification of a Linux distribution (RHEL).</li>
</ul>
