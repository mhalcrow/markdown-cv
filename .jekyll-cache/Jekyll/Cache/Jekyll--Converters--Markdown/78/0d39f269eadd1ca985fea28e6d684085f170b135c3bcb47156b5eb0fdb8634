<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>I seek a leadership opportunity applying deep security expertise to
unique challenges.</p>

<p>I am currently the Engineering Manager of the Container Threat
Detection product team at Google. I hired and led a team of software
developers to create a new enterprise security product in Googleâ€™s
Cloud Security organization. My team <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-container-threat-detection-overview">shipped
its Beta product</a> in May 2020.</p>

<p>I bring 20 years of experience in the security industry. My most
noteable accomplishments include <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9400">eCryptfs</a> and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/639427/">fs-crypt</a>, both of which
are part of the upstream Linux kernel. My technology was central in
Googleâ€™s effort to encrypt billions of Android devices across the
globe, closing a major competitive gap with the Apple iPhone.</p>

<p>I thrive in ambiguity and relish opportunities to lead the industry in
whatever challenge I take on.</p>

<p>Founding Member of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Security Organization.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I built the team from scratch, hiring on 9 new employees from
outside the company and transferring in 3 employees from other
teams at Google. I established the teamâ€™s engineering culture,
drove execution, gave career guidance, and navigated the team
through the COVID-19 crisis to ship our Beta product in record
time, moving from concept and no headcount to delivery with 12
employees in about 18 months.</li>
  <li>I demonstrated adaptability in managing a disparate group of
software engineers, including 1 new hire straight out of college, 4
junior professional hires, 2 experienced professional hires, 2
internal transfers, and 3 engineers with doctorates in security and
ML.</li>
  <li>I designed the kernel instrumentation and the Google service
framework, and I led my teamâ€™s execution on an ambitious vision.</li>
  <li>I led Machine Learning experts on my team to produce novel
techniques in the threat detection domain.</li>
</ul>

<p>fs-verity</p>

<ul>
  <li>I wrote the initial prototype of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw5h6aBhu6M">fs-verity</a>
and led my team to drive the implementation through to merging into
the upstream Linux kernel. The fs-verity feature now protects the
integrity of sensitive apps on Android.</li>
</ul>

<p>fs-crypt</p>

<ul>
  <li>I proposed the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/639427/">fs-crypt</a> project, wrote
the design, and wrote the majority of the implemention together
with Ted Tâ€™so, a well-known core Linux kernel maintainer. I engaged
the Android team at Google to ensure that fs-crypt met platform
requirements, extended fs-crypt to support Inline Cryptographic
Engine (ICE) technology thatâ€™s part of the ARM ecosystem, and
worked with engineers in the Android organization to <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/11/pixel-security-better-faster-stronger.html">ship
Android N with storage encryption</a> enabled by default.</li>
  <li>fs-crypt also protects user data on Chrome OS and sensitive data on
Googleâ€™s production infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloud KMS</p>

<ul>
  <li>I conceived the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kms">Google Cloud
Key Management Service (KMS)</a> project and proposed the initial
design. I transitioned the project to another team that specializes
in key management, and they drove it to commercial success.</li>
</ul>

<p>Customer-supplied Encryption Keys</p>

<ul>
  <li>I led the design and implementation of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/encryption-at-rest/customer-supplied-encryption-keys">Customer-supplied
Encryption Keys (CSEK)</a> on Google Compute Engine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compute Engine Persistent Disk Encryption</p>

<ul>
  <li>I proposed, designed, and implemented storage encryption as an
always-on feature of Google Compute Engineâ€™s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/persistent-disk">Persistent
Disk</a>, which was an industry-first accomplishment in the Cloud
space. I applied AEAD encryption to block storage while meeting
consistency and performance requirements, which is a notable
technical achievement.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="microsoft-2009-2011">Microsoft, 2009-2011</h3>

<p>Windows Division, BitLocker</p>

<ul>
  <li>I delivered <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-group-policy-settings#bkmk-ospw">passphrase-based
system volume protectors</a> for the BitLocker Full Disk Encryption
feature, unblocking a significant number of enterprise customers so
they can use Windows-native disk encryption technology.</li>
  <li>I performed static code analysis of the Windows code base.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ibm-2003-2009">IBM, 2003-2009</h3>

<p>Linux Technology Center, Security</p>

<ul>
  <li>I created <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9400">eCryptfs</a>. For
many years eCryptfs protected storage on consumer devices such as
Synology NAS, and at least one startup, Gazzang, based its core
product offering on eCryptfs.</li>
  <li>I wrote extensive detailed documentation of low-level Linux system
call interfaces, which was critical to achieve the worldâ€™s first
Common Criteria certification of a Linux distribution (RHEL).</li>
</ul>
