## Overview

I am seeking a leadership opportunity in a security organization
that's facing significant changes in its domain. I prefer a fair
degree of ambiguity in the definition of the problem space and/or the
potential solution.

I am currently the Engineering Manager of the Container Threat
Detection product team at Google. In this role I hired and led a team
of software developers to create a new enterprise security product in
Google's Cloud Security organization. My team <a
href="https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-container-threat-detection-overview">shipped
Beta</a> in May 2020.

I have over 20 years of experience in the security industry, during
which time I created <a
href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9400">eCryptfs</a> and <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/639427/">fs-crypt</a> in the upstream
Linux kernel. My technology was central in Google's effort to encrypt
billions of Android phones across the globe, closing a major
competitive gap with the Apple iPhone.

## Employment History

### Google, 2010-present

Container Threat Detection

 * I built the team from scratch, hiring on 9 new employees from
   outside the company and transferring in 3 employees from other
   teams at Google.
 * I did the initial design on the kernel instrumentation and the
   Google service framework, and I led my team's execution on that
   vision.
 * I led Machine Learning experts on my team in the concept and
   implementation of malicious script detection capability.

fs-verity

 * I wrote the initial prototype of <a
   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw5h6aBhu6M">fs-verity</a>
   and led my team to drive the implementation through to merging into
   the upstream Linux kernel. The fs-verity feature now protects the
   integrity of sensitive apps on Android.

fs-crypt

 * I proposed the <a
   href="https://lwn.net/Articles/639427/">fs-crypt</a> project, wrote
   the design, and wrote the majority of the implemention together
   with Ted T'so. I engaged the Android team at Google to ensure that
   fs-crypt met platform requirements, extended fs-crypt to support
   Inline Cryptographic Engine (ICE) technology that's part of the ARM
   ecosystem, and worked with engineers in the Android organization to
   <a
   href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/11/pixel-security-better-faster-stronger.html">ship
   Android N with storage encryption</a> enabled by default.
 * fs-crypt also protects user data on Chrome OS and sensitive data on
   Google's production infrastructure.

Cloud KMS

 * I conceived the Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) project
   and proposed the initial design. Note that another team that
   specializes in key management took over the project and drove it to
   completion.

Customer-supplied Encryption Keys

 * I led the design and implementation of Customer-supplied Encryption
   Keys (CSEK) on Google Compute Engine.

Compute Engine Persistent Disk Encryption

 * I proposed, designed, and implemented storage encryption as an
   always-on feature of Google Compute Engine's Persistent Disk, which
   was an industry-first accomplishment in the Cloud space. I applied
   AEAD encryption to block storage while meeting consistency and
   performance requirements, which is a notable technical
   achievement.

### Microsoft, 2008-2010

BitLocker

 * I contributed some features to the BitLocker Full Disk Encryption
   feature that ships as part of the Windows operating system.
 * I performed static code analysis of the Windows code base.

### IBM, 2004-2008

 * I created eCryptfs.
 * I wrote extensive documentation of low-level Linux system call
   interfaces to help achieve the world's first Common Criteria
   certification of a Linux distribution (RHEL).
