## Overview

I am currently the Engineering Manager of the Container Threat
Detection product team at Google. In this role I hired and led a team
of 11 software developers to create a new enterprise security product
in the Cloud Security organization. My team <a
href="https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-container-threat-detection-overview">shipped
Beta</a> in May 2020.

I have over 20 years of experience in the security industry, during
which time I created <a
href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9400">eCryptfs</a> and <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/639427/">fs-crypt</a> in the upstream
Linux kernel. My technology was central in Google's effort to encrypt
billions of Android phones across the globe, closing a major
competitive gap with the Apple iPhone.
