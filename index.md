## Overview

I seek a leadership opportunity applying deep security expertise to
unique challenges.

I am currently the Engineering Manager of the Container Threat
Detection product team at Google. I hired and led a team of software
developers to create a new enterprise security product in Google's
Cloud Security organization. My team <a
href="https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-container-threat-detection-overview">shipped
its Beta product</a> in May 2020.

I bring 20 years of experience in the security industry. My most
noteable accomplishments include <a
href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9400">eCryptfs</a> and <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/639427/">fs-crypt</a>, both of which
are part of the upstream Linux kernel. My technology was central in
Google's effort to encrypt billions of Android devices across the
globe, closing a major competitive gap with the Apple iPhone.

I thrive in ambiguity and relish opportunities to lead the industry in
whatever challenge I take on.

## Employment History

### Google, 2011-present

Founding Member of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Security Organization.

<a
href="https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-container-threat-detection-overview">Container Threat Detection</a>

 * I built the team from scratch, hiring on 9 new employees from
   outside the company and transferring in 3 employees from other
   teams at Google. I established the team's engineering culture,
   drove execution, gave career guidance, and navigated the team
   through the COVID-19 crisis to ship our Beta product in record
   time, moving from concept and no headcount to delivery with 12
   employees in about 18 months.
 * I demonstrated adaptability in managing a disparate group of
   software engineers, including 1 new hire straight out of college, 4
   junior professional hires, 2 experienced professional hires, 2
   internal transfers, and 3 engineers with doctorates in security and
   ML.
 * I designed the kernel instrumentation and the Google service
   framework, and I led my team's execution on an ambitious vision.
 * I led Machine Learning experts on my team to produce novel
   techniques in the threat detection domain.

fs-verity

 * I wrote the initial prototype of <a
   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw5h6aBhu6M">fs-verity</a>
   and led my team to drive the implementation through to merging into
   the upstream Linux kernel. The fs-verity feature now protects the
   integrity of sensitive apps on Android.

fs-crypt

 * I proposed the <a
   href="https://lwn.net/Articles/639427/">fs-crypt</a> project, wrote
   the design, and wrote the majority of the implemention together
   with Ted T'so, a well-known core Linux kernel maintainer. I engaged
   the Android team at Google to ensure that fs-crypt met platform
   requirements, extended fs-crypt to support Inline Cryptographic
   Engine (ICE) technology that's part of the ARM ecosystem, and
   worked with engineers in the Android organization to <a
   href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/11/pixel-security-better-faster-stronger.html">ship
   Android N with storage encryption</a> enabled by default.
 * fs-crypt also protects user data on Chrome OS and sensitive data on
   Google's production infrastructure.

Cloud KMS

 * I conceived the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kms">Google Cloud
   Key Management Service (KMS)</a> project and proposed the initial
   design. I transitioned the project to another team that specializes
   in key management, and they drove it to commercial success.

Customer-supplied Encryption Keys

 * I led the design and implementation of <a
   href="https://cloud.google.com/security/encryption-at-rest/customer-supplied-encryption-keys">Customer-supplied
   Encryption Keys (CSEK)</a> on Google Compute Engine.

Compute Engine Persistent Disk Encryption

 * I proposed, designed, and implemented storage encryption as an
   always-on feature of Google Compute Engine's <a
   href="https://cloud.google.com/persistent-disk">Persistent
   Disk</a>, which was an industry-first accomplishment in the Cloud
   space. I applied AEAD encryption to block storage while meeting
   consistency and performance requirements, which is a notable
   technical achievement.

### Microsoft, 2009-2011

Windows Division, BitLocker

 * I delivered <a
   href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-group-policy-settings#bkmk-ospw">passphrase-based
   system volume protectors</a> for the BitLocker Full Disk Encryption
   feature, unblocking a significant number of enterprise customers so
   they can use Windows-native disk encryption technology.
 * I performed static code analysis of the Windows code base.

### IBM, 2003-2009

Linux Technology Center, Security

 * I created <a
   href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9400">eCryptfs</a>. For
   many years eCryptfs protected storage on consumer devices such as
   Synology NAS, and at least one startup, Gazzang, based its core
   product offering on eCryptfs.
 * I wrote extensive detailed documentation of low-level Linux system
   call interfaces, which was critical to achieve the world's first
   Common Criteria certification of a Linux distribution (RHEL).
