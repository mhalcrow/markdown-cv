## Overview

I am currently the Engineering Manager of the Container Threat
Detection product team at Google. I have over 20 years of experience
in the security industry, during which time I created eCryptfs and
fs-crypt in the upstream Linux kernel. My technology was central in
Google's effort to encrypt billions of Android phones across the
globe, closing a major competitive gap with the Apple iPhone.
