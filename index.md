## Overview

I seek a leadership opportunity applying deep security expertise to
unique challenges.

I am currently the Engineering Manager of the Container Threat
Detection product team at Google. I hired and led a team of software
developers to create a new enterprise security product in Google's
Cloud Security organization. My team <a
href="https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-container-threat-detection-overview">shipped
Beta</a> in May 2020.

I have over 20 years of experience in the security industry, during
which time I created <a
href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9400">eCryptfs</a> and <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/639427/">fs-crypt</a> in the upstream
Linux kernel. My technology was central in Google's effort to encrypt
billions of Android phones across the globe, closing a major
competitive gap with the Apple iPhone.

I thrive in ambiguity and relish opportunities to lead the industry in
whatever challenge I take on.

## Employment History

### Google, 2011-present

<a
href="https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-container-threat-detection-overview">Container Threat Detection</a>

 * I built the team from scratch, hiring on 9 new employees from
   outside the company and transferring in 3 employees from other
   teams at Google.
 * I designed the kernel instrumentation and the Google service
   framework, and I led my team's execution on an ambitious vision.
 * I led Machine Learning experts on my team to produce novel
   techniques in the threat detection domain.

fs-verity

 * I wrote the initial prototype of <a
   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw5h6aBhu6M">fs-verity</a>
   and led my team to drive the implementation through to merging into
   the upstream Linux kernel. The fs-verity feature now protects the
   integrity of sensitive apps on Android.

fs-crypt

 * I proposed the <a
   href="https://lwn.net/Articles/639427/">fs-crypt</a> project, wrote
   the design, and wrote the majority of the implemention together
   with Ted T'so. I engaged the Android team at Google to ensure that
   fs-crypt met platform requirements, extended fs-crypt to support
   Inline Cryptographic Engine (ICE) technology that's part of the ARM
   ecosystem, and worked with engineers in the Android organization to
   <a
   href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/11/pixel-security-better-faster-stronger.html">ship
   Android N with storage encryption</a> enabled by default.
 * fs-crypt also protects user data on Chrome OS and sensitive data on
   Google's production infrastructure.

Cloud KMS

 * I conceived the Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) project
   and proposed the initial design. I transitioned the project to
   another team that specializes in key management, and they drove it
   to commercial success.

Customer-supplied Encryption Keys

 * I led the design and implementation of Customer-supplied Encryption
   Keys (CSEK) on Google Compute Engine.

Compute Engine Persistent Disk Encryption

 * I proposed, designed, and implemented storage encryption as an
   always-on feature of Google Compute Engine's Persistent Disk, which
   was an industry-first accomplishment in the Cloud space. I applied
   AEAD encryption to block storage while meeting consistency and
   performance requirements, which is a notable technical
   achievement.

### Microsoft, 2009-2011

Windows Division, BitLocker

 * I delivered passphrase-based system volume protectors for the
   BitLocker Full Disk Encryption feature, unblocking a significant
   number of enterprise customers so they can use Windows-native disk
   encryption technology.
 * I performed static code analysis of the Windows code base.

### IBM, 2003-2009

Linux Technology Center, Security

 * I created eCryptfs.
 * I wrote extensive detailed documentation of low-level Linux system
   call interfaces, which was critical to achieve the world's first
   Common Criteria certification of a Linux distribution (RHEL).

## Education

Master of Science in Computer Sciences (MSCS), UT Austin, 2007.
