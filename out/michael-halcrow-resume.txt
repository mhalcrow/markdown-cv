   Engineering Manager, Security.

Overview

   I seek a leadership opportunity applying deep security expertise to unique
   challenges.

   I am currently the Engineering Manager of the Container Threat Detection
   product team at Google. I hired and led a team of software developers to
   create a new enterprise security product in Google’s Cloud Security
   organization. My team shipped its Beta product in May 2020.

   I have 20 years of experience in the security industry. My most noteable
   accomplishments include eCryptfs and fs-crypt, both of which are part of
   the upstream Linux kernel. My technology was central in Google’s effort to
   encrypt billions of Android devices across the globe, closing a major
   competitive gap with the Apple iPhone.

   I thrive in ambiguity and relish opportunities to lead the industry in
   whatever challenge I take on.

Employment History

  Google, 2011-present
  Kirkland, WA

   Founding Member of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Security Organization.

   Container Threat Detection
   Staff Engineering Manager

     * I built the team from scratch, hiring on 9 new employees from outside
       the company and transferring in 3 employees from other teams at
       Google. I established the team’s engineering culture, drove execution,
       gave career guidance, and navigated the team through the COVID-19
       crisis to ship our Beta product in record time, moving from concept
       and no headcount to delivery with 12 employees in about 18 months.
     * I demonstrated adaptability in managing a disparate group of software
       engineers, including 1 new hire straight out of college, 4 junior
       professional hires, 2 experienced professional hires, 2 internal
       transfers, and 3 engineers with doctorates in security and ML.
     * I designed the kernel instrumentation and the Google service
       framework, and I led my team’s execution on an ambitious vision.
     * I led Machine Learning experts on my team to produce novel techniques
       in the threat detection domain.

   fs-verity
   Staff Technical Lead Manager

     * I wrote the initial prototype of fs-verity and led my team to drive
       the implementation through to merging into the upstream Linux kernel.
       The fs-verity feature now protects the integrity of sensitive apps on
       Android.

   fs-crypt
   Senior Software Engineer

     * I proposed the fs-crypt project, wrote the design, and wrote the
       majority of the implemention together with Ted T’so, a well-known core
       Linux kernel maintainer. I engaged the Android team at Google to
       ensure that fs-crypt met platform requirements, extended fs-crypt to
       support Inline Cryptographic Engine (ICE) technology that’s part of
       the ARM ecosystem, and worked with engineers in the Android
       organization to ship Android N with storage encryption enabled by
       default.
     * fs-crypt also protects user data on Chrome OS and sensitive data on
       Google’s production infrastructure.

   Cloud KMS
   Senior Software Engineer

     * I conceived the Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) project and
       proposed the initial design. I transitioned the project to another
       team that specializes in key management, and they drove it to
       commercial success.

   Customer-supplied Encryption Keys
   Senior Software Engineer

     * I led the design and implementation of Customer-supplied Encryption
       Keys (CSEK) on Google Compute Engine.

   Compute Engine Persistent Disk Encryption
   Software Engineer III

     * I proposed, designed, and implemented storage encryption as an
       always-on feature of Google Compute Engine’s Persistent Disk, which
       was an industry-first accomplishment in the Cloud space. I applied
       AEAD encryption to block storage while meeting consistency and
       performance requirements, which is a notable technical achievement.

  Microsoft, 2009-2011
  Redmond, WA

   Windows Division, BitLocker
   Senior Software Engineer

     * I delivered passphrase-based system volume protectors for the
       BitLocker Full Disk Encryption feature, unblocking a significant
       number of enterprise customers so they can use Windows-native disk
       encryption technology.
     * I performed static code analysis of the Windows code base.

  IBM, 2003-2009
  Austin, TX

   Linux Technology Center, Security
   Software Engineer

     * I created eCryptfs. For many years eCryptfs protected storage on
       consumer devices such as Synology NAS, and at least one startup,
       Gazzang, based its core product offering on eCryptfs.
     * I wrote extensive detailed documentation of low-level Linux system
       call interfaces, which was critical to achieve the world’s first
       Common Criteria certification of a Linux distribution (RHEL).

Education

   Master of Science in Computer Sciences (MSCS), UT Austin, 2007.

   Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCE), BYU, 2002.

Miscellaneous

   I help instruct Google’s internal Interview Training Workshop, where I
   prepare new employees to conduct interviews at Google. I’m also a leading
   interviewer in my organization, and I’m frequently called upon to
   interview Product Managers, Engineering Managers, Software Engineers, Test
   Engineers, and Technical Program Managers.

   I am an inventor on 15 issued patents.

   I have made multiple external presentations at the Linux Security Summit
   (LSS) and the Ottawa Linux Symposium (OLS).

   I lead Google’s internal bicycling forum for the Seattle area,
   coordinating rides, giving presentations, and facilitating engagement with
   charity events.
